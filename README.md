# Battleship

This is a Battleship game made for the Odin Project. Copyright 2025, me, Robert Eisenman, etc. etc.

This was mainly meant to demonstrate my skill in Jest, and test-driven development in general, as well as to bring things together in a full game like this. There's nothing overly special about this game. It's Battleship. To restart, refresh the page, sorry. You can play against a computer that might be a bit too smart (though its logic gets janky when you place ships near each other), or you can play against another human. Use honor, no peeking, pass the monitor properly.

Ship placement will base itself from the square you click on to the right if orientation is horizontal and down if vertical. Placements are not final until confirmed.

| Ship | Size |
